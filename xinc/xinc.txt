    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:
        xinc.ivy: line 23: test.invar3

    The following action implementations are present:
        xinc.ivy: line 17: implementation of test.transition

    The following initializers are present:
        xinc.ivy: line 13: test.init[after2]

    Initialization must establish the invariant
        xinc.ivy: line 23: test.invar3 ... PASS

    Any assertions in initializers must be checked ... PASS

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:
        (internal) ext:test.transition
            xinc.ivy: line 23: test.invar3 ... FAIL
